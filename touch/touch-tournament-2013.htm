				<h3 class="center">2013 Touch Tournament</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						Yesterday's touch tourney went well with 8 teams competing on a regular schedule leading up to a 
						final competition between Columbia and DC Galaxy with DC Galaxy exhibiting their professional brand 
						of play to outdistance all teams.  Much of the support was to help raise funds for supporting 
						the growth of touch rugby with Hope in South Africa and during the day we had 
						representatives from S.A. in attendance to observe and support.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Geese day on the pitch was a good one as we lost to the eventual champion DC galaxy in the 
						Semi-finals of the championship bracket (our 5th match of the day).  DC Galaxy used their 
						wizardry to confound us.  They were the most effective on the day of utilizing all of the space 
						on the less than regulation fields.   Their experience playing together showed as the Geese 
						comprised a team that played together for the first time with some learning the rules on the day.  
						Roger Lecroy did a great job of Captaincy for the day to manage substitutions for 15 or so players.  
						Roger pointed out that we had the greatest age range from 62 (Wayne Harrison) to Joseph at 
						11 (Niko's son).  Larry, a new guest to the team recruited by lost his rugby touch scoring 
						virginity twice - a good prospect for 15s too.  Travis Harrison was the try master of the day 
						before he had to leave early.  Joseph dotted to help us tie Frederick.
					</p>
					<p>
						Touch team:  Rick Devens, Wayne Harrison, Travis Harrison, Jeremy Dold and his recruit Larry, 
						Roger Lecroy, Brian Collins, Brian and Special from Western Suburbs, (Tom Leary played 
						however he joined the Exiles HS team for their need for experience), Jim Willard, Niko and his son 
						Joseph.  Steve Strickland a goose organized the Frederick Team and Duma another goose led 
						the DC Galaxy team.  The Geese played well however the lack of playing time together hurt 
						our ability to properly mark our opponents as most scores agains were due to some kind of mismatch.
					</p>
					<p>
						DC Touch had two teams and showed the most polish and consistent quality of play with the most 
						players contributing to our tournament and their teams also exhibited the most gender diversity.
					</p>
					<p>
						My guess is that approximately 30 players learned the game of FIT touch for the first time including 
						the Exiles HS team who had a touch transition from 15s and tackle to touch, however clearly had 
						significant rugby skills and steadily improved during the day.  Thanks to Dan Soso for bringing his 
						High School players out to participate - one of our key goals with the this tournament is to keep 
						it relaxed and expand the awareness of FIT rugby to youth in the area.
					</p>
					<p>
						We had 2 players drive up from Kitty Hawk, NC to play
					</p>
					<p>
						The Washington Scandals team never played before and showed great sportsmanship to get out and 
						compete as they learned.
					</p>
					<p>
						Thanks to Jon Warner as the gracious host and major contributor providing beverages, guidance, ice 
						delivery (150Lbs) and a post match social with live music.  We took full advantage of Jon's tasty 
						well water to help hydrate the teams with ice cold water in Igloo coolers.
					</p>
					<p>
						Cliff did his usual outstanding job with food preparation with plenty of chicken, salads, watermelon, 
						and corn on the cob!  
					</p>
					<p>
						Falaniko utilized his touch tournament experience on Friday to help layout the field so that we had 
						substitution boxes in the middle of the field and two evenly spaced paddocks.  A very professional 
						layout.  His experience with touch tournaments in Samoa helped us do the right things and he has 
						more ideas we can build on.  Rick Devens and Cliff helped Niko and I get the fields lined on Friday.
					</p>
					<p>
						Barr and Jeff Lange ran the tourney matrix like clockwork and helped collect funds and handle the 
						myriad  of questions and kept referees on track.  Neal supported us with the jerseys and the 
						treasury department.  Final figures are tbd however it appears we stayed in the black.
					</p>
					<p>
						Tony headed up a referee team that handled 36 games on the day!  Although the heat and humidity were 
						moderated some on Saturday the sun was intense and sunburn and heat drain were prevalent.
					</p>
					<p>
						Andy Murren was instrumental in building a webpage to facilitate communication to include directions 
						and logistics along with a paypal option.  And Roger Chaufornier helped ensure that we had the 
						logistics covered to include helping designate volunteers for key efforts -  a wise move.
					</p>
					<p>
						Kevin Groner showed up and helped refuel the volunteers that started to sputter at the end of the 
						day helping resupply water, grill food, fill as a sub on matches, and volunteer to ref if someone 
						told him the rules!
					</p>
					<p>
						The teams DC Galaxy, Frederick, DCTouch (2), Washington Scandals, and Exiles and Geese took over the 
						hill side with tents.  Cliff wisely suggested keeping the food at one end so not to divide the teams 
						along the hill.  It is a different experience to leave the pitch after 5 games of touch vs. several 
						games of 15s - the body does not talk nearly as much after touch.
					</p>
					<p>
						So all in all a good day and we learned a lot to help us out for the next time.  The visiting teams 
						raved about the property and the pitches so it appears we should be able to recruit similar attendance 
						in the future, particularly as the sport of FIT rugby grows.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am certain there are other volunteers and contributors not mentioned only because there were so 
						many that helped so if you weren't mentioned take pride in the fact that you helped make a great day 
						at Gosling Park.  Honk!
