<b>State of the Flock Address:</b>

<p>First, on behalf of the Wild Geese we wish to thank all of
you for your engagement, contributions and support in 2008 and we look forward
to continuing our great traditions in 2009.&nbsp; Thanks to Matt Downs for the
great schedule of matches this past spring and fall.&nbsp; The Wild Geese
retain our stellar record on the field as fiercely competitive;nbsp; and off the field as one of the more social and
organized old ruggers groups around.&nbsp; Thanks
again to Wayne Harrison for our new
  jerseys.&nbsp; This past year also witnessed the
birth of a new Old Boys team; the French Embassy Roosters! </p>

<p>Our November &nbsp;tournament
was&nbsp; a great example. We had enough players to run three games in a round
robin fashion.&nbsp; A great time was had by all and we contributed the spark
to encourage groups like Western Suburbs, PAX River,
the Roosters and others to continue to grow and keep the old boy spirit alive.</p>

<p>Recently, a group of the
informal leadership of the Geese convened to reflect on the activities of the
past year, the club needs and the future direction of the club. To follow are
some important items to reflect on.</p>

<p><b><i>Who Runs the Geese and What the Heck is the Junta?</i></b></p>

<p>The Wild Geese is a virtual, informal collection of kindred
spirit.&nbsp; </p>

There are:

<ul>

<li>no officers,</li>
<li>no bylaws,</li>
<li>no formal bureaucracy.</li>

</ul>

The Geese are led informally by
a group who volunteer their time to support the club.&nbsp; This group and the
process are open to whoever wishes to contribute. Over the years there have
been the same core recurring group who
participate.&nbsp; 

<p>The group operates by consensus
and convenes periodically to discuss club matters.&nbsp; </p>

<p>That group is affectionately
referred to as the <b><i><u>Junta</u></i></b><i>. </i>Recently, the Junta
expanded to include some of the newer members of the club. The Junta is
currently made up of the following people: Matt Downes;
Rick Devens ;Roger Chaufournier ; Michael Fortier;
Larry Jannes; Henry Breton; Brian Collins; Cam Dunlop and Barr Snyderwine .</p>

<p>Thankfully, many others have
contributed their time including Don Cotchen, erry Cave,
Tim Harrington among many others.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Junta has evolved and individuals joined the Junta out of their interest and
passion supporting the club.&nbsp; All serve as ambassadors of the Geese in a
variety of venues.</p>

<p>In our recent meeting it was
suggested that greater transparency to the membership on how the club functions
and some of our current plans would help continue to reinforce the positive
direction we are heading.</p>

<p><b><i>Mission</i></b><b><i>
of the Geese</i></b></p>

<p >In a discussion of our <st1:City
w:st="on">Mission it was noted that
most of the Founder’s have stopped playing by this point with a few exceptions.
Some of the founders who were engaged early on have also commented that there
may not be a reason to stay on the email list since so much of the activity is
focused on current players most of whom are now strangers.&nbsp; We felt it
important to clarify our view of the mission of the club to encourage all
members, old and new, to stay engaged.&nbsp; Our draft mission is as follows:</p>

<p>The Wild
Geese RugbyFootball Club is a community of
physically active&nbsp;35 and older men and their families sharing the physical
and gentlemanly&nbsp;tradition and spirit of rugby with each other and their
families.</i></p>

<p>We welcome feedback and suggestions on this mission.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b><i>Principles We Hope to Preserve</i></b></p>

<p>The Junta identified four key principles we hope to preserve
as we move forward. They include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Welcome all New Comers</li>
<li>Remain family friendly</li>
<li>Retain our Informality</li>
</ul>


<p>Our goal will be to provide
venues for people to remain engaged in Rugby
and as members of the Wild Geese irrespective or their location, age and
ability to play.&nbsp; Our active playing side will obviously be the core of
what the club does. However, strategically we are aiming to provide additional
mechanisms for the club and members to remain engaged with the team and ugbycommunity with an aim of retaining a long term view
for the Club.</p>

<p><b><i>Goals for the Next Five Years</i></b></p>

<p>The Junta recognized there were key activities that were
necessary to sustain the club including the following elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sustaining 4-6 games a season (8-12 a year)</li>
<li>Playing touch summers and winters</li>
<li>Continued recruitment to grow the club</li>
<li>Annual gathering for Club (Christmas or post holidays)</li>
<li>Maintain Gosling Park as our home base</li>
<li>Retain Our Club branding including our jerseys, new shorts and socks</li>

</ul>

In addition to these core elements, the following goals were developed:

<ul>
<li>Sustainable dues
structure</li>
<li>Support a tour every few years to bring the Geese together</li>
<li>Raise $5-10k a year for a common cause (Youth Rugby) was proposed</li>
<li>Perpetuate touch rugby as a player pipeline for our sport</li>
<li>Grow dues paying members to at least 40 a year</li>
<li>Grow the club to ensure viable numbers to support a playing team and
support the additional goals</li>
<li>Encourage growth of the 35+ age bracket</li>
<li>Sponsor an Annual Tournament</li>
</ul>


<p><b><i>Where do the Dues Go?</i></b></p>

<p>It was clear from our gathering
that most are clueless on the financial mechanics of the club and where dues
go.&nbsp; First, it is important to acknowledge that there are a small cadre of
people who really have helped keep the glue together through their direct
financial commitments and their time and energy. These include:</p>

<br/><br/>
<p>This year there have been some additional extraordinary
expenses including the following:</p>

</div>

<br/><br/>

Our dues structure is $75 a year.&nbsp; That breaks
down to less than $10 per person per each fifteens game.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our dues
are for a calendar year. In 2008 so far year to date we have 30 people who have
paid dues.&nbsp; Our goal is at least 40 a year.&nbsp; It appears we will end
the year just about break even.&nbsp; As a result, we will really depend on
dues for 2009 which will be due in by March 1 2009 to support our
obligations.&nbsp; Dues do not cover CIPP fees to USA Rugby nor do they cover
catering of our home events.</p>

<p><b><i>Hosting Teams</i></b></p>

<p>Part of the success of our home games has been our field
(thanks to Jonathan Warner) and the generous contributions of our players for
food for our home matches.&nbsp; We have benefitted from kegs provided by
Brewers Alley of Frederick for our home matches and Jeff Arendt and Jonathan
Warner have always coordinated these libations on our behalf.&nbsp; However, we
really need people to make a conscious effort to bring hamburgers, hot dogs,
buns or appetizers (e.g. chips) and water to the home matches.&nbsp; We have
had a few matches where a couple of key people who normally bring a generous
contribution weren’t able to be there and we ended up with slim pickings as a
result.&nbsp; Whatever is left over that is salvageable goes into a freezer in
Jonathan’s root cellar for our next match.&nbsp; Keep those burgers and dogs
coming!</p>

<p><b><i>The Grey Goose</i></b></p>

<p>We would like to find ways to keep the alumni engaged
without overwhelming anyone with the weekly flow of emails around
matches.&nbsp; As a result, we hope to launch soon a separate list for alumni or those who want the periodic news and not
the day to day soap opera of the routine email.&nbsp;&nbsp; This new list serv
will provide announcements of upcoming tours, special
events, and periodic updates from the club.&nbsp; You are welcome to stay on
the routine Yahoo group list. Stay tuned!</p>

<p><b><i>Commitment to Youth Rugby</i></b></p>

<p>It is important to note that members of the Wild Geese
family have been very active contributing to the community through youth rugby
programs.&nbsp; The Wild Geese contributed financial support this past year to
the PRU Select Side Youth Program and the Alexandria Youth Program.&nbsp; In
addition, we have proven to be a breeding ground of coaches for youth programs
in the area including:</p>

<b><i>Wild Geese Foundation</i></b></p>

<p>One of the issues that as been kicked around for a while is the desire of some to
establish a legacy of the Wild Geese.&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been two causes
that have been put forth worthy of efforts to form a Foundation. The first is
to raise enough capital to establish a rugby complex in the ashington area that would be a permanent
home for rugby.&nbsp; The second cause is Youth Rugby.&nbsp; A decision was
made to try some modest fund raising efforts as a precursor to launch of a Wild
Geese Foundation to support one or both of these causes.&nbsp; Look for more
information in the future.</p>

<p><b><i>Upcoming Tours
and Tournaments</i></b></p>

<p >The Junta recognized that  special vehicle for keeping the Geese engaged are
tours.&nbsp; In 2009 we will be supporting a team in t. Lauderdale
in February as we have the past five years.
Brian Collins is organizing that tour.</p>

<p >An experiment was tried on
November 16 as an Old Boys Ruggerfest.&nbsp;&nbsp;
One of the key issues is the dwindling number of teams in old boys at anbsp; time when many routine clubs have players ready to
migrate to old boys.&nbsp; We are targeting ways to try to grow that 35+ age
bracket of players.&nbsp; We hope to sponsor an annual old boys
tournament in D.C.&nbsp; This weekend’s tournament was a beginning.</p>

<p>Plans have also begun for
another international tour.&nbsp; Suggestions have included <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Argentina</st1:country-region>, Bermuda,
<st1:country-region w:st="on">Ireland</st1:country-region> and the Golden
Oldies in Sydney
in 2010.&nbsp; Mike Fortier and Roger Chaufournier are working on the plans for
the next international tour.</p>

<p><b><i>Annual Party</i></b></p>

<p>The Junta discussed plans for an annual party.&nbsp; This
year, the Winter Holiday Season Gathering will be held on Thursday, December 18
at 7:00 at Bistro Doc located at 518
  10<sup>th</sup> Street, NW in Washington D.C.&nbsp; A modest amount of appetizers will be provided but
expect a cash bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plans are underway for a family gathering In
January on a Sunday afternoon concurrent with touch rugby.&nbsp; Look for more
information in the near future.</p>

<p><b>Winter Touch Rugby</b></p>

<p>The winter touch rugby program begins Sunday, January 11
2009 at 1:00 at Potomac Elementary School in ethesda.</p>

<p><b><i>Summary</i></b></p>

<p>We hope this information has proved
to be of interest and helpful.&nbsp; We look forward an exciting 2009.&nbsp; We
welcome any ideas or suggestions and will keep you abreast of next
opportunities to engage or contribute to the team.</p>
