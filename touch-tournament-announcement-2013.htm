						The Wild Geese "Old Boys" Rugby Football Club is hosting a touch rugby tournament at  
						<a href='http://www.wildgeeserugby.org/warner_farm_directions.htm' target="_blank">Gosling 
						Park</a> (20500 Martinsburg Road, Dickerson, MD 20842) on Saturday 29 June 
						starting at 11am - with a pre-match training from 10-10:30 for beginners.

						and the youth supported by "Hope in South Africa."
					</p>
					<p> 
						Open to all comers: male, female, young and old, new and experienced. You don't need to 
						have a whole team, just come out and we will place you on a team! Youth 12 and 
						above welcome (or speedy and experienced 10/11 year olds).  Gosling Park is situated on a 
						beautiful historic farm site with 2 pitches, not far from Poolesville, MD. Located near the  
						C&O canal - which is great for hiking and biking - bring the family and kids for a day of fun.
						<br />
						Players should bring plenty of water and everyone should bring chairs and shade tents 
						(there are no shade trees next to pitch).

						More teams can easily be added 	or come individually and we'll get you on a team!	While not essential, it is 
						recommended that teams have a uniform or similar colored shirts.
