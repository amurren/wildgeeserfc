   <td colspan="3" bgcolor="white">Write-up (by Brian Collins): 
The Wildgeese competed with the Poltroons in a tough and close match that the
Geese ended up winning after three 20 minute periods. A strong showing of the 
Geese was welcomed by Jonathan Warner's beautiful farm and the leader of us all 
delivered beautiful weather. There were some amazing feats like Nick Carino and 
Dave Stuart, despite their girth managed to elude substitution and played all 
60 minutes.
<BR/><BR/>
Jeff Arendt started the scoring with a "save my ass kick" high to their 
fullback that took an Arendt bounce that he fell on for a 40 meter kick and 
score. Later the shorter Roger made a beautiful scoop of a post tackle ball 
and niftily touched down in the corner. Nico showed beautiful form by kicking 
for post penalties and conversions - a rarity for the Geese. Nico also set 
down a try as did Aaron I believe. The Poltroons put down a try late. Somebody 
else for the Geese scored. It was a very entertaining action packed game.
<BR/><BR/>
Several Geese filled with the Poltroons - Matt Downs and several others. 
The Geese match followed the Renegades hard fought close loss to the visitors 
from somewhere near the Bay. John France is continuing to improve this team 
and even played in the Geese match for the final 10 minutes that was really 
17 as Matt Downs felt the need for just a little more rugby.

Jon recruited several South Africans to bring some real intensity and 
fanfare to the world cup finals between South African and England that 
South Africa won in a dull game punctuated by more than excessive kicking.
<BR/><BR/>
After the game hayrides, great food, beer, open bar, cigars, lies, and a 
variety of other activities greeted the sunset on one of the more beautiful 
spots in the Washington D.C. area.

   <td colspan="3" bgcolor="white">Write-up (by Brian Collins): 
The Geese, Poltroons, W. Potomac and Western Suburbs gathered for the 
2nd edition of the Washington Area Old Boy Smackdown and Whorefest.  
The Geese fielded a strong team, thanks to Wild Geese version 2.0.  
Veterans Roger C., John Booch, Guy, Roger (other), Dave Stuart (gamely playing 
despite a bad dental condition), Cole Black, Jeff Lange, Chris Augusty and 
Yours Truly were joined by v2.0ers Aaron, Henry, Larry, Jeffs Walsh and Daly, 
Phil, Chris's Linder and Gerard (whoring against us), Jean Louis, Niko and 
Joel, and v2.0 patch Scott Davis (?).  If I missed a name, its due to age, 
not malice.
<BR/><BR/>
The Geese played two 15 minute quarters against a good but not complete 
Poltroons squad.  Scoring were Jeff Lange and Niko off good second phase ball 
from the forwards and good ball movement and support among the backs.  
Final: Geese 12, Poltroons 0.
