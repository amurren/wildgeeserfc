						<p>
							We had a very active summer touch season with runs every week from the middle of June to the middle of August. 
							We also have started entering teams in the Mid-Atlantic touch circuit. For those not familiar with the Federation of 
							International Touch (FIT); touch rugby is a sport of its own with a very high level of competition and a very strong following.  
							We hosted our own touch tournament this past fall and we will do so again this fall.  In fact, we will try to encourage touch 
							rugby at our matches either before or after so more folks can stay engaged and those who prefer that version of the 
							game can participate.   
						</p>
						<p> 							
							In the meantime, for the next few weeks touch will be held Monday nights at 7:00 at TC Williams school.
						</p>
