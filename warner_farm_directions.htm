<h5>Text Directions:</h5>
 
<p>
If you are coming from Germantown you can use Rt-28 and if you are close to Leesburg, VA you can take Whites ferry.  I'll give 
directions from these places below. 
</p>

<h5 class="directions">If coming from the north (Frederick or Pennsylvania): 
</h5>

<ul>
<li>
From Frederick, take Rt-15/270 South to Rt-85/Buckeystown Pike South (10 miles).  Rt-85 south will become Rt-28 south (5 miles). 
</li>
<br />
<br />
<li>
Enter Montgomery County and pass through the small town of Dickerson.  
</li>
<br />
<br />
<li>
About a mile past the town Rt-28 makes a 90-degree left turn (flashing orange light). 
</li>
<br />
<br />
<li>
Bear right to turn onto Martinsburg Road.    
</li>
<br />
<br />
<li>
Note: The sign for Martinsburg Road is very small – you probably won't even see it so slow down as you approach the flashing orange light   
</li>
<br />
<br />
<li>
On Martinsburg Road you will go down a hill then up another and bear left to avoid entering an industrial center. The road becomes a one lane concrete road, at the fork bear right - follow signs for warm water fishing.   
</li>
<br />
<br />
<li>
Pass Dickerson Conservation Park on the right go up the hill and the farm is on the right – there should be some corner flags beside the gate. 
</li>
<br />
<br />
<li>
The pitch is behind the house so go past the house and turn at the gate with the rugby ball on the pos, drive to the left of a mall barn/shed and park in the field. 
</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="directions"> If coming from the south (Northern Virginia or Germantown/Rockville): 
</h5>

<ul>
<li>
Take I-95 north to I-495 (beltway) towards Tyson's corner/Rockville. 
</li>
<br />
<br />
<li>
Then I-495 to I-270 north towards Rockville/Frederick You need to get in the local lanes. 
</li>
<br />
<br />
<li>
Take Rt-28 West (away from Rockville).  On Rt-28 you will travel out of the city and into the country a 
few miles from I-270. As you approach Dickerson, Rt-28 makes a 90-degree right turn 
(flashing orange light). 
</li>
<br />
<br />
<li>
Bear left to turn onto Martinsburg Road. The sign for Martinsburg Road is very small – you probably won't 
even see it so slow down as you approach the flashing orange light. On Martinsburg Road you will go down a hill then up another and bear left to avoid entering an industrial center. The road becomes a one lane concrete road, at the fork bear
