						<h2>Wild Geese Touch Rugby</h2>	
						<p>
							The Wild Geese Touch Rugby started out as a way to keep fit by playing weekly refereed touch 
							rugby matches throughout the summer and winter. The Wild Geese is now expanding to include
							year round touch for men and women 35-and-over under the FIT rules. Our touch rugby matches 
							are open to anyone who enjoys fun and competitive play, camaraderie, and the reknown exceptional 
							hospitality of the Wild Geese.  Our home touch pitch is our excellent Gosling Park, but match 
							locations change so we can play other Touch Rugby teams in the Maryland/DC/Virgina area.
