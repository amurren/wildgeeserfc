<h3 class="center">The History of the Wild Geese Rugby Football Club</h3>
<p class="medium">
The First Flight of the Wild Geese (1691)
To many Americans, the term 'The Wild Geese' means nothing. To a few who are 
old enough, they might think of the 1978 Richard Burton movie about mercenaries 
fighting in Africa by that name. To those that know their history, they know 
'The Wild Geese' refers, originally, to the Irish soldiers that served under 
Patrick Sarsfield and fought the army of Dutch Prince-turned-English King 
William of Orange to a standstill in Ireland.
<br/>
<br/>
These Irish soldiers were given the option, as part of the 1691 Treaty of 
Limerick, after the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, of sailing to France to join 
James II (the Stuart king of England) in exile. Many soldiers sailed  to 
France, and formed the foundation of the Irish Brigade that served in the 
French Army for the next 100 years.
<br/>
<br/>
French ships, which came to the west coast of Ireland smuggling brandy and 
wine, would leave with recruits for the Irish Brigade. To hide their movements 
from the English, the men would be listed on the ship's manifest as 
'Wild Geese,' thus the origin of the name. The Wild Geese served not only in 
Catholic countries like France, Spain and Italy, but they also fought with 
such non-Catholic countries such as Russia, Germany and Austria. There were 
two Irish field marshals in the Austrian army, two in the Russian army, eight 
in the French army, five in Italian army, and twelve in the Spanish army during 
a 150-year span. That is one of the highest ranks given in any army. There 
were also two Irish field marshals who served under Napoleon and one notable, 
Bernando O'Higgins who led the liberation of Chile, Peru, and Columbia, is 
revered as a saint in South America. The name "Wild Geese" later became 
synonymous with the hundreds of thousands of Irish emigrants whose talents 
were to flower abroad.- the flight of the "Wild Geese" served to spread Irish 
influence throughout Europe
<br/>
<br/>
<u>The  Second Flight of the Wild Geese</u>
<br/>
<br/> 
In 1698,the forefathers of Wild Geese Rugby Football Club Founders, Michael 
Balitsaris Fortier, Roger Chaufournier, Donald Cotchen, Tim Harrington, 
Mike McGavick, James McVey, Pepe O'Malley, and Dave Stuart  (bastard son of 
the Jacobite King James Stuart) having elected by mutual by unanimous consent, 
to stay on in Limerick for last call after their fighting brethren left for 
France in 1691, decided to sample the culinary and   cultural wonders of the 
France. Being latecomers to the formation of Patrick Sarsfield's Irish Brigades 
then in French royal service, and taking umbrage that these eight gentlemen of 
noble pedigree were not immediately offered line commands of the nascent Irish 
regiments, decided that their path would lie in the formation of a rugby club, 
hence the birth of the Wild Geese RFC in 1698, as depicted under the Silver 
(signifying old boys) Goose crest  on the club's jersey  - dark blue for France 
and the sea that separates the eight  from home and complimented by a kelly 
green collar and 2  green stripes on the jersey arms (highlighting both their 
origins  as veteran players for the Washington Irish RFC  and their sartorial 
sense that green and blue are by their  very nature complimentary  colors)
More than two hundred years later, the Washington DC-area based Wild Geese 
<br/>
<br/>
Rugby Football Club carries on the tradition of attracting rugby players from 
around the United States and the World that will travel from the four corners 
of Washington DC and the Seven Continents, sporting the Silver Wild Goose,  
to have a "go" at anyone, anytime, anyplace. The Geese  welcome players from 
any rugby club or background that are dedicated to playing open attacking rugby.

<br/>
<br/>
The Wild Geese coat-of-arms with the Goose Rampant and the motto "In Hoc Anser Vinces" 
(which means for the ill-read "In this Goose Conquer") descends 
directly from the motto of the (Wild Geese) Irish in French military service 
during the 18th Century: "In This Sign Conquer" depicting both that 
exhortation and the Irish Harp on the regimental colors.  The "sign" dates 
to the alleged vision of the Christian cross to Roman General Constantine 
in 312 A.D. before the military battle with his political rival and pagan 
Maxentius for the throne of the Roman Empire. Constantine won the battle, 
making him Emperor,  and, in gratitude, Constantine openly supported the new 
religion in the Roman Empire and it therefore spread throughout the western 
world with official blessing.  Mother Geeseland, home to the Wild Geese Rugby 
Football Club, similarly recognizes the virtues of a world best served by rugby 
and embraces all.
