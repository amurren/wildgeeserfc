				   The Wild Geese had an awesome day of rugby yesterday hosting the Baltimore Brumbies and the Washington Irish.  
					The Irish were a bit lean with six or seven guys so we blended together the teams.  It was a hard fought and 
					scrappy day with Baltimore scoring early on and throughout only to have the Irish-Geese bounce back.  Lee Coogle 
					captained our squad as we won a handful of tries to their couple of tries.  Tries were scored by our backs Brian 
					Collins, Jason,  Travis Harrison (son of Wayne who almost created a riot due to his youth and speed)  and Suki 
					(the other under 30 player who snuck in and almost created the second riot). Thanks to Ross for getting the ball 
					out of some messy rucks and mauls. I thought the Geese showed great grace giving our two speedy young players 
					to the other side for the last period.  You know we are having a great day when two props score thanks to Mike 
					Thornton and William.   In fact our front row anchored by Neal Henderson and Booch with the engine room anchored 
					by yours truly, Tom Rege, William and Brian Stotler,  held our own throughout the match.  We hoisted Lee up in the 
					line out and he poached at least three of their balls.  Lee and Stacks as wing forwards enabled us to get to the 
					scrumhalf and flyhalf often and kept the ball messy for their backline.  Brian Stotler was back in grand form after 
					a bit of time away from the game.  Wayne Harrison had that rare chance to play father son as did Tommy Evans and 
					his boy.  Very cool to have father and son tandems on the field at the same time. Dumas and Tom Rege made their 
					usual contributions both on and off the field.  Jason and Kenny were beasts as usual up the middle and just so much fun 
					to see in action and to be with them on the field.  Sean O’Donnell served notice early on with his slicing and 
					dicing through the crowd. Chris anchored many a ruck and led a few pick and go cycling.  
				</p>
				<p>
					The only downer of the day was Danny Dawes hurt his knee and Barr cracked a rib. We wish both a speedy recovery.    
					Baltimore had a couple of hard fought tries as well and pressed us up the center often.   They were  a good bunch 
					of guys there to play hard and enjoy a good day of rugby.  We gave them a good match and provided them a great post party.
				</p>
 				<p>
					A word on our wings.  We had some bantering last week about wing’s and whether that was really considered a playing 
					position or a position for spectators and wannabe players (all in jest of course). As I saw Andy Murren march off 
					the field with a bloodied nose yesterday after taking a bloke down (I counted four tough open field tackles on his part) 
					in an open field tackle that could have led to a score.  Our wings all played really well yesterday as they have all season.  
					In fact, as I look back over the years we have really been blessed with great wings who were tough as nails and showed 
					great poise under pressure including Willie Monahan, Aaron Mayhew, Niko (French), Chris Augusty, Jim Willard and 
					Dave Drazen to name a few.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the post party celebration Clifford served up a pulled pork sandwich with a rosemary au jus gravy and French bread 
					accompanied by a chick pea based salad perfectly turned and accented with tomato slices, parsley and celery.  A Brewer’s 
					Alley Kolsch was a great drink to wash down the meal.  Chef Ramsey would have moved Clifford on to the next round 
					of the rugby culinary competition.  Well done Clifford once again.! Thank you for your time, energy, passion and camaraderie.

				We ended the spring season in grand style by hosting the Bermuda Onions 
				over the course of an action packed weekend.  A delegation of Geese met 
				the Onions at their hotel Friday night and escorted them on to the 
				Australian Embassy for an evening where I understand our combined 
				entourage were one of the highlight’s of the evening.  The Onions were 
				up early to catch a British Lions match at Fado’s and then on to our 
				match.  The Geese played one of our better matches despite a 6-4 try loss 
				to the guests.  
				</p>
				<p>
				In grand style our tourists honored storied traditions associated with 
				rugby tours including initiation rights for tour rookies. Thank goodness 
				Pedro vindicated our honor with the Gosling Rum 151 flame thrower 
				challenge. Well done Pedro!  Welcome to rugby rookies Dave and Jim!  
				Thanks to Clifford and Barr for coordinating and preparing food and for 
				all who volunteered and helped out and all who donated to make sure we 
				hosted our guests as a return favor for their own gracious hospitality on 
				our last tour to Bermuda. 
				</p>
				<p>
				The match now makes the Geese 0-2 against the Onions and demands a 
				repeat tour to <a href="http://worldrugby.bm/" target="_blank">Bermuda</a> to vindicate ourselves!

				Yesterday was a great day of rugby for the Washington Rugby Community and for the Wild Geese.  The Roosters 
				started the day by playing a tough match against NOVA.  The match was followed by a Poltroons hosted over 50 
				match.  Approximately 42 over 50 players from Harrisburg, Annapolis, Virginia, Baltimore, Dc, Maryland and 
				New Jersey came together for four 15 minute periods.  A Wild Goose motley side took on the Poltroon Motley 
				side for a 3 try to 2 ending result.    The day concluded with an after match BBQ and two kegs of beer and a 
				firework display in the form of a nasty thunderstorm that cleared the premises around 4:30 p.m..  Jonathan 
				Warner was presented an Irish “loving" Cup by DC iconoclastic old man of rugby Woofie who generously handed out 
				bridge tips and his macadamia nut liquor.
				</p>

				<p>
				Neal brought the new T-shirts which are selling fast and are a huge hit!  Thanks Neal for all of your efforts. 
				They are $20 a shirt and fit great, have a nice feel and great artistry.  Hats will be in this week selling 
				for $20 a hit as well.
				</p>

				<p>
				I want to thank Dave Drazen and Tom Leary, Jeff Lange and Jeff Walsh for prepping the fields.   Clifford was 
				sorely missed with his on and off the field talents. That said, thanks to Barr for stepping up and doing the 
				food shopping and cooking.  Jonathan also contributed a nice pork roast.   Thanks to all who helped serve food 
				during and clean up. A special thanks to Dave Drazen, Chris Gerard, Kevin Groner who helped me in the blinding 
				rain and lightning to get all the final clean-up done and rescuing the remainder of the keg  from the elements.     
				Also thanks to all who contributed their match day fee to help defray costs of the event especially Kenny 
				Orndoff for his generous contribution.

				The Geese played a strong match yesterday winning 27-10 with two tries coming in the last few minutes.   
				We had a full side but had to share a player with Robert Dillon graciously stepping up and playing 
				second for the opposition and I refereed. As a result we played 13 on 13.   Our pack was made up of 
				the steady Mike Bruce, Booch and Neal Henderson anchoring the front row. The rest was made up of all 
				loose forwards with Justin and Will playing second row, Dutch and Guellermo as the loose forwards.  
				That may explain one of our best loose and rucking games in a while, although the ref let a lot of loose play.
				</p>
 				<p>
				The back line was made up of Chris Gerard (loose forward), Tom (Flanker), James (English), Jim (new guy), 
				Cole(old guy), and Walt (flanker) was scrumhalf.  As you can see, we mixed it up quite a bit.
				</p>
 				<p>
				Unfortunately, Guillermo took a bad fall when he planted his foot only to have a ruck roll over him. Two 
				broken bones as of 1:42 am.  Kudos to Walt and Chris for staying at the hospital to take him home. 
				Thank goodness his doctor is a former rugger!

				The Wild Geese had a great day of rugby and hosted graciously by the Poltroons. 19 Geese posted by game time.   
				It was incredible as the Poltroons apparently had arranged for all their families to set up tents with names 
				of their clans on them and bagpipes and food and what looked like a thousand people. They must have big families. 
				In any event, the weather was awesome, the scenery picturesque and the Geese won something like 28-24. Neal 
				Henderson scored the tickets for us an ensured smooth entry and then went on to play his heart out and in fact 
				took him a  while to calm his engine down after the game.  Roger LeCroy led as captain and set the tone by getting 
				ball out early at scrumhalf for a few quick scores. Big Joe Freeman was his usual bulldozer self. Chris Gerard 
				set rucks like he was writing the manual. Dutch was all over the field, snapping ball out of the air in lineouts 
				and constantly directed the forwards in rucking. Our back line had numerous long runs. English James (heard 
				afterwords saying “you know 20 years ago I would have scored”) had a great burst through the back line to get us 
				downfield.   Ross had a great try off a messy ball near the goal line. In my opinion though, the try of the game 
				came from Tim Desmond who also burst downfield and facing 12 guys (well, maybe just two) pooch kicked the ball 
				through and ran it down into the try line as he was being pursued and tackled.  Prop Tim D made his usual trek 
				in from Pennsylvania and gave the front row needed relief, through accurate ball in the Lineouts and from the 
				pics dug out a few balls for the backs.  As always he brought that magic home brew in the jar (several of our 
				lads were complaining about short term memory loss after downing his jar, maybe that is what they make that 
				date rape drug from?).  Dillon made Chris Gerard proud after his scrimmaging pre-game tutorial and introduced 
				his new puppy to rugby.  Andy, our resident JAG (yes, just like the guys on TV) had a solid game at second row 
				(believe me, he is pretty solid as I had my arm around his waste at second row).  From the pictures, Stacks 
				and Mike Bruce were rucking away and Stacks also did some platooning at jumper. Kenny, Brian, Niko, and Zach 
				presented the opponents constant pressure, stiff defense and a few great runs.  Potomac Jim made his debut in a 
				full match at wing (those YouTube clips you are watching are paying off Jim).  Jeff Lange has two savings tackles 
				and a  few good runs. Jason from Western Suburbs also filled in nicely in the backline.  Lastly, Barr kept the 
				ball deep and mostly out of bounds from some tight back defense at fullback.
