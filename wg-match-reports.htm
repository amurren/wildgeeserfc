We lost first game in a tough match with the Roosters - we dropped our guard unprepared 
on at least two penalty plays for then from about the 10-15 meter and they banged em in.
<br/><br/>
Then we evened the score vs Poltroons comfortably winning by keeping them out of the 
try zone.
<br/><br/>
Wade had a hat trick of tries. The Roosters had a nice feed on for all players - 
thanks for all to have a good turnout - our pack was a powerhouse in the 2nd match 
producing good ball to run

Good spirited play with a match closer than the score. Geeselander&#39;s rucking and tackling 
were consistently good all match.  Quick hands and good ball handling all around allowed 
for several classic textbook rugby tries.

Chef Clifford&#39;s BBQ table was the real winner, made even more palatable with authentic 
homemade tzatziki sauce that your lone Hellenic citizen much valued&#46;&#46;&#46;long with the

Congratulations to the Poltroons who never lost spirit for all these years, and were 
truly the better team yesterday. The only thing better than the 'Troons was the 
combined side of Clifford's BBQ, Jonathan's farm and the weather.
<br/><br/>Geese Rugby rounded out a close third, and will no doubt shake off the rust and 
rise again. We were in it right up until time ran out. The highlight was when we 
stopped them in an epic goal line stand in the third period - Big Joe and Andy bearing 
the brunt. Too many missed tackles and too few successful attacks tipped the balance 
against us. Thanks to new recruits Walt's-friend-Will and Dutch for giving blood. 
We saw several other new players as well. Walt, Dutch, and Walsh each had a try. 
Tim Desmond made some great runs but was stopped and didn't get the support. 
Representing the old guard: Cole Black made his return; Wayne Harrison played 9 for a
while; Booch played all but 10 minutes; Henry played more than half the match at prop;
Barr played the first period matched with a very strong inside center (and didn't back
down) before moving to fullback; Cam gave it his all until he went off late in the
match a little banged up; Brian played very well as he always does, and the same
ror Willie; Steve Thronson is ramping up to another pinnacle season to celebrate
his upcoming 50th. Notably absent was Zach who was at Ruggerfest in Aspen with
a select Cardinals side.

A few facts from the Well Fed Geese game:
<ul>
<li>14 Lineouts:   6 were ours and we lost one.  8 were theirs and we won two of theirs.</li>
<li>12 scrums:  7 for them , 4 for Geese.  We won all of our scrums and took away one of 
theirs. </li>
<li>9 Poltroon Penalties;  13 Geese Penalties five of which came in the last few minutes 
in succession on a  goal line stand. </li>
<li>All of our penalties were for off-sides, except for 
one for barging in the scrum, one not releasing and one hands in. </li>
</ul>
A few observations from the sidelines.
<ul>
<li>We allowed the ball to die near the loose and did not work to get the ball out the 
line fast</li>
<li>We kicked far too much when we should have run at the opposition (as evidenced by 
the number of lineouts we had). When we did kick there was no follow up and as a result 
we gave the opposition strong attacking position</li>
<li>We had two opportunities to do pick and rolls on their goal line and instead 
tied the ball up in the maul</li>
<li>We ran into tackles high and risked turning the ball over</li>
<li>Scores by Jeff Walsh, Dutch and Walt-  Well done…</li>
<li>We had an awesome goal line stand with big Joe, Justin  and others really smacking 
them back.  On the other end of the field Will and Dutch were clearing people out; 
with Dutch having the scars to prove it! </li>
</ul>
For Dave Stuart's benefit , the food was awesome and many kudos go to Clifford.  
The chicken had a rub that left you clamoring for more; the pork BBQ melted in 
your mouth and the meatloaf smoked tenderly for hours was like "butter."  The hand 
chopped Coleslaw was reminiscent of the northern Oregon variety; fresh; light on 
vinegar or seasoning and delicious.    An outstanding spread was put out which keeps 
up our reputation as not only a great competitive team to play but we throw one hell 
of a party!  Dave, since you are retired why don't you throw on an apron and come out 
and BBQ with us!

The horses up front performed admirably yesterday.  We started the day opposing a very big, tough 
French team.  While they spent the bulk of the first 15 minutes in our half, and despite committed 
charges at our try line, our forwards were a solid match, playing great defense.  In the second 15, 
the roles were somewhat reversed as the Geese spent most of that period attacking.  Neither team 
could get over the line and that match ended with a Jeff Stack penalty kick making the difference.  
Lots of hard running and hard tackling.
<br/><br/>
The next 30 minutes saw the Geese take on another big, tough team from Harrisburg.  It was good to 
see these guys make such a long drive in such good numbers.  Perhaps they should have brought a 
few less players as they beat the Geese I think by 1 try, maybe 2, to 0.  Again, lots of hard 
running and hard tackling.  
<br/><br/>
The final 30 minutes saw the Rooster and Hobos in a rather, um, spirited match, again dominated by 
forward play.  Unfortunately, this match was marred by a yellow card, a penalty try and then a red 
card.  Still, it was a great day and great rugby.  Thanks to the French for hosting a 3-way and 
thanks to the Hobos for traveling in such numbers.
<br/><br/>
Big games from Jeff Walsh, Cam Dunlop, Brendan, Weston, Zak, Dillon, Phantom (is that his name?) and 
Dave and the others from the Old Grays and all the forwards.  Great work.   Thanks to the other new 
recruits -- Tom Leary from G'town law and Justin from the Navy for joining us.  There were a few other 
new faces whose names I didn't get, ignored or forgot, so I hope others will chip in and spread the credit.  
<br/><br/>
There is some discussion about a final match next Sunday at the Farm.  Perhaps Henry can conjure a 
way to permit the Flock to express online their interest and availability for a match on the 9th 
without suggesting that anyone has true voting rights or expectations that his wishes may be noted, 
considered or respected.

Great matches yesterday, men.

A most enjoyable game. Very little of that ephemeral superficial Southern Hemisphere &quot;basketball rugby&quot;. 
That was more the stuff from which legends are made - at least around the fire at Roger&rsquo;s.
<br/><br/> 
I would like to add a few comments.
<br/><br/> 
I would like to sanction our rough Argentine friend for his callous attempt to break that tall fellas 
knuckles with his eye socket. Poor form. You will have to buy the first round at Roger&rsquo;s.
<br/><br/> 
Brendan for acting Moses, and parting the sea for us all day long.
<br/><br/> 
Jeff Walsh for tackling his heart out, and our Old Gray friend Dave Lazzo(?) for his goal line stand.
<br/><br/> 
The props kept us on the front foot at every scrum. Even against Thomas who not so long ago played Super 
League, and was a key player in the MARFU All Stars team of 2005-2007.
<br/><br/> 
Collins showed us why we rarely get breaks through the fly half area, taking down guys twice his size. 
&quot;They can&rsquo;t run without legs, by goom!&quot;.
<br/><br/>
Staacky for hitting the goal at the right time.
<br/><br/> 
I am afraid that I can only bring myself to be generous to forwards, so I will leave the rest of the 
plaudits to someone with a clean jersey.
<br/><br/>
Good work fellas. I am becoming a grizzled old curmudgeon when it comes to our game play, but that little 
effort gave me a tingle.

It was clearly a forwards game thanks to the narrow field.
<br/><br/>
There was not much to do with so little space. The tackling was good however when the forwards ran wide.
<br/><br/>
And I did slow the big guy that ran hard with the white socks as he ran over me so someone else could make 
the tackle.

Early in the match when the Roosters made a number of attacks by quickly peeling off of their mauls, it 
was Cam who saw it coming and stopped them at the gain line. The grizzled old curmudgeon led by example 
and we all soon followed to play the hardest fought 3-0 victory I can think of.  Shout to Tom for a great 
job at flanker in his Geese debut.

Yesterday we played two full matches in cold and windy conditions, first against the Poltroons 
and then against the Suburbs.  The Geese had a brilliant day with stellar performances by many 
-- Other Roger, Roger, Niko, Jeff Walsh, Steve from Frederick, Walt, Willy, Jeff Lange, Big Joe, 
Guillermo to name only some names.  The Geese pack played well against two good packs, John Booch 
played the lineouts well in wind and took a few against the head.   The back line did what a 
back line should do with the ball -- run and pass, a lot.  There was tremendous passing, lots 
of hands touching the ball, lots of good angles, lots of opportunism.  Even in the midst of it, 
it was a delight to watch.  A wide, artificial field helped spread out the defense and let us 
use our speed to great effect.  Others that kept count should comment, but I think we scored 8 
or 9 tries agains the Poltroons and 3 or 4 against the Suburbs and gave up only 1 all day.  
Guillermo himself would have had 2 more tries but for unfortunate knock-ons in-goal while being 
tackled. 
<br/><br/>
All teams played good, clean rugby and all games were officiated well by Buzz McClain who showed a knack for letting us play while keeping things clean.  Both the Poltroons and Suburbs were good, but missed some of their strength we've seen before.  
<br/><br/>
A Lovely day.

The Wild Geese flocked to a balmy, cool and wet field in Harrisburg yesterday morning 
and a very tough battle over a worthy and strong opponent.  In all fairness, the HOBOS 
were not at their usual full strength despite being at home.  Neither were we on the road. 
Yet, four concussions, one separated shoulder, one broken toe, and one bar room brawl 
later we walked off the field a winner 26-12.  Thanks to Chris Gerard  for serving as 
referee and doing a  very capable job. A few first half statistics to consider:

<ul> 
<li>The Hobos had 4 penalties and we had 3.  Three of theirs were for off-sides and one obstruction.  Ours were or sealing and not releasing.
<li>They had four scrums and won them all; we had three and won them all.
<li>We had five lineouts and won them all. They had four lineouts and lost one.
<li>This all translated to a stoppage of play about every sixty to ninety seconds.
</ul>
Sorry, stats were not kept for the rest of the game.
<br/><br/> 
The day started off on a sour note as the HOBOS broke through our line for a nice scamper to 
the corner. The conversion was good.  Our feathers were ruffled.   Our first try of the day 
began with Nikko breaking through at our 10 meter line and then as the opposition converged did 
a perfect little pop kick to Doug Carmichael (yes Jimmy McVey he did you proud) who broke 
through several tackles and slid in for the try.  The conversion was good by Martin Aud 
(fresh off  a plane from Argentina).    The second half had  the Geese pressing again and 
following a break through the line Willie Monahan scampered away for another try. The 
conversion was made.  Later in the second half  Nikko burst through and again after a nice 
run and the ball made its way to Walt Kennedy who cut back across field and ran a good 55 
meter score to the right corner with two HOBOS in tow. Conversion was good.  
<br/><br/>
The Hobos came back and pushed a score through the strong defense to make the score 21-12.  
Late in the game newcomer Lee scooped up a ball and head down, ears pinned back punch through 
a solid defense to make the score 26-12.   This was a tough, tough match. Willie and Doug both 
had their bells rung.    Nikko separated his shoulder and had to have it reset at the hospital.  
I broke my toe and popped some stitches.  Two of their players had bad concussions,  
one being knocked out cold for a scary few seconds  .  It got really testy at one point 
resulting in a  bar room brawl on the right sideline.  Imagine a 5 foot 8 scrumhalf grabbing 
6 foot 6 Steve Thronson by the neck and slapping him.  Big Boy Thronson (“I’ve had bigger 
breakfasts than you!”) cocked that arm and with a steel stair almost decapitated the bloke.  
All hell broke loose and one HOBO stood up and punched a Goose on the ground. Mistake made. 
Out of nowhere comes Stiffie (aka Cliff the Assassin) and cleared him out  (I heard the poor 
lad muttering on the ground  “But I don’t want to eat my peas mommy!”).  Once the testosterone 
rush was over play resumed with referee Chris sking whether everyone had fun. 
<br/><br/>
So many great things to say about the match. Chris Dunleavy (former Irish) made his debut 
and demonstrated a  full court press throughout his tenure.  Walt Kennedy scored two weeks 
in a row and taking season scoring leadership away from Zach.  Neal Henderson and Mike Roth 
started as anchors in the pack and gave us a platform for winning our ball all day.   
Nic Chaufournier (hooking) was a beast cleaning up the loose and making several down 
field charges. In one scamper he bowled over a HOBO and sent him flying. Steve Thronson 
and Ed Shafer started the game in the engine room. Big Ed made four of five big tackles 
in the loose.  Cam  and Steve secured ball all day from the lineout.  We had two sets of 
props with Neal Henderson, Mike Roth, Lee and Jeff Walsh rotating through.  Jeff made 
several bruising tackles and newcomer Lee was scooping off ball from the floor like a hoover 
vacuum cleaner.  Mike Roth almost scored a try but was held back by a vicious goal line stand. 
Clifford was wreaking havoc in the loose. At one point the HOBOS had clean ball in a ruck and 
Stiffie (aka Clifford the Assassin) reached through the ruck and pinned back the scrumhalf’s 
shoulders so he could not reach the ball.  That led to dirty ball and trouble for the HOBOS.
Guillermo Auad provided a pre-game tutorial on the pick and roll and we tried a new pick and 
roll play several times. In fact, we got the pick part right, just others forgot to roll the 
second time around.  It was also fabulous to have Guillermo’s brother Martin (on holiday) 
capably playing in the back line and with Guillermo’s  son at wing. At one point Guillermo 
went up field and off loaded to his brother and the ball finally weaved back to his son at 
winger.  That raises a question, when three Aud’s touch the ball is that called a “TRAUD?”  
I asked Guillermo’s sister in law if she wanted to join the family at winger but she 
politely declined.    Lee Coogle was his feisty little self playing well, tackling like a 
maniac and even tussling twice.  Brian Collins was especially sharp with his foot and 
placed the ball down the field in several timely moments clearing us away deep from our 
territory.  Jeff Lange had one of his better performances in memory and got quite a 
lot of ball allowing for 3 or 4 down the sideline runs.   Then there is Dave Stuart.  
One could go on all day long about Dave. I won’t.  That said to the shock of many, 
Dave was very quiet on the field but executed flawlessly and provided us with a return 
of his patented forearm to the top of the head as he runs you over maneuver.
<br/><br/>
Tahita (aka Jeff Payne) hosted a terrific after party at his home overlooking the river.  
He had spent all day cooking a pig, sprinted to field only to play for the HOBOS, messing 
up ball for the Geese  and proving to be a headache for us all day, then sprinted back to 
be host.  It was a great after party, good eats, Landshark Ale on tap and good camaraderie.  
The HOBOS are great guys and we play a  tough match each year. This one goes into the 
memory books.  Thanks Tahita for the hospitality!!!!
<br/><br/> 
For those interested anger management classes will be held prior to the next match which is 
a week from this Saturday against Baltimore at Gosling park. More to follow!!!!

Yesterday we kicked off the fall 2011season in grand style ( I believe our 36th season as old boys.  Kind of scary when you have played longer as an old boy than you did Men's and collegiate!).  
We had a very strong showing against a strong side. A few interesting statistics to consider:
<ul>
<li>There were 13 scrums.  5 to the Geese (we lost 1) and 8 to the French (they lost 3).</li>  
<li>We knocked on more but dominated their pack in the scrum.</li>
<li>There were 21 lineouts (13 to the Geese and 8 to the French).  We lost 2 lineouts and the French lost 3.</li>
<li>There were a total of 18 penalties. 9 to each side.</li>
<li>The French were penalized:</li>
<ul>
<li>2 not releasing</li>
<li>1 late hit resulting in sin bin</li>
<li>4 offsides</li>
<li>1 obstruction</li>
<li>1 hands in the ruck</li>
</ul>
<li>The Geese were penalized:
   <ul>
<li>2 offsides</li>
<li>1 not releasing in a ruck</li>
<li>1 late hit</li>
<li>3 killing the ball in the ruck</li>
<li>1 high tackle</li>
<li>1 playing the ball on the ground</li>
</ul>
</ul>
Our terms of scoring points for the season so far we have the following:
<ul>
<li>Nikko - 5</li>
<li>Walt - 5</li>
<li>Zach - 5</li>
<li>Rigby - 5</li>
<li>Stacks - 6 (3 conversions for goal)</li>
</ul>
Final score  26-5.   A great day of rugby.  There was so much good about the day we could spend hours on the dialogue. Steve Thronson was a beast stealing two lineout balls, three smothering tackles and a few up the field bursts.  The three penalties awarded against him shows he was in the play  (hands, high tackle and not releasing).  Chris Gerard poached several balls from the French from the loose. Clifford hasn't even gotten his rugby legs back yet and was disruptive in the loose and throwing people around. Newcomer Walt showed his fitness and skills by constantly being in the loose and in pursuit and was awarded for that effort with a  try.  Guillermo had  a great disruptive tackle jarring  the ball loose and while staying on his feet punched the ball down field. He dribbled it two more time into Rigby's hands for a nice 70 meter in total movement.   Our front row stayed fresh with our rotating five props in and out (Neal, Mike Bruce, Mike Roth, Bill Judge, Jeff Way).  We also had five in the engine room including Jeff Weston (Mr. Lineout), Tom Regge, Guy Enderle, Steve Thronson, and Ed Shafer.  Not a bad set of engines I might add!    Jeff kept snatching messy ball all day in the lineout and stabilized us all game long. Tom Regge also was strong in the lineout and in the loose play charging up field for a few scampers and rolling mauls.  The loose forwards included Walt, Chris Gerard, Clifford, Guillermo and Robert.  Jeff Stacks and Nic Chaufournier shard hooking duty and each displayed their on the field talents with strong tackles and loose play.
<br/><br/>  
The back line was constantly challenging on offense and really smothering on defense against a  strong back line. It had to be a frustrating experience for the other side as every time they got momentum we were there in pursuit. Tim "I eat raw meat for breakfast" Desmond had a 50 yard run cross field and tackled a breakaway runner who was surely set to score. The French fellow being tackled popped the ball up to a mate in pursuit yet, it was our own pursuit that led to a  goal line defense. We were saved when the French were penalized at our 5 meter line  and we cleared downfield for touch.  Andy, our new recruit showed that studying 14 years of rugby videos can translate into on the field poise. He made two tackles and had a beautiful catch at our 15 meter line under pressure in his debut. Niko returned fresh from a month training with the Samoan world cup team and came back fitter than he left and ready to crash that midline.  He had six runs up the middle stiff- arming players and sucking in the defense to set up the outside runners.   Zach, last season's leading scorer,  has taken it upon himself to set a new record for yards run before scoring with another long scamper down the sidelines. We'll mark your first try of the season as a 35 yard scamper.  Matt Downes (Mr. "Can you make sure the cameras on when I send those perfect spirals from the ruck?) and Lee Coogle (put me in coach anywhere but left-out) split halfback position and traded time in the back line.  Brian Collins also showed his superb defense with three shoe string tackles that saved potential breakaway runs.  Rounding out the backs included Steve from Frederick, Jeff Lange, newcomer Joe McCallister.  So, we had in essence two full sides for the match and managed to get it all done in a  seamless way. Well done to all.  You can stop recruiting for a while as it looks like our bench strength is pretty deep for now!     Our road trip to Harrisburg will be a good test as Larry and his boys will be ready to put some wood to us..
<br/><br/>  
The final score of the after party was 11 remaining Geese and 3 French at the time of my departure.  Thanks to all the families and friends to come out including former American Eagle and Irish player Herb Berst! 
<br/><br/>  
Speedy recovery to Tom Regge.  We love your play and need you back!
<br/><br/> 
Also a special thanks to the team for dues support this year.  We will be doing some field work later this year at Gosling park and the wheels are in the works for a new set of team jerseys.      We have done well on dues collections and that you all for contributing your share.  We'll  drop the nagging from the email and chatter and instead zoom in on those who haven't paid.

The WG turned out for a good match with North Bay shutting them out until late in the 
last period.
<br/><br/>
The win came from another dominating outing by the Pack with Big Joe, Booch, and 
Guillermo leading the way.
<br/><br/>
Doug Carmichael injected great pace and energy to the WG backs who took the plentiful 
ball from the pack to make some nice runs. Jeff Weston dominated in likeouts and Steve 
Thronson handled the kickoffs Tim D., Neal and the return of Henry B handled the front 
row. The Other Roger had a great game at S-half and Roger C had a solid match as usual. 
Nic C filled for North Bay and caused us some headaches. Nikko and Chuck anchored 
the centers and shut down their potent back line. Willie had a nice 50 yd scamper and 
dotted a 2nd time. Jeff Lange and Jeff Walsh rounded out the backs with Walsh taking a 
deep kick and turning it into a movement ending in a try. Jeff Stacks played his usual 
steady play solid in the loose.

North Bay was a little light after a busy rugby weekend Sat and a reunion party Sat night. 
We had a nice social with burgers dogs and beverages.

WildGeese and a Poltroons contingent joined forces to go 2 and 0 and capture the 
prestigious Celtic Cup for 2011 by beating both the Iron Rugby and Alexandria French in 
a sundrenched day of good fun and camaraderie.

Henry B's prescient use of Group Me text messaging gathered the flock for a group 
entrance to the pitch where we proceeded to play a well executed brand of rugby led by a 
powerful ball winning pack that fed to an anxious gaggle of backs that put points on the 
board.
<br/><br/>
MVP Chuck Goldston who broke the ice early and continued to set up scores all day.

Hustle Player of the day Zach with at least two dots

Forward of the day David Lazzo with a beautiful try and outstanding set play and loose 
play including stellar defense.

Organizer of the Day Matt Downs - arranged for the outing back in Jan/Feb and led the 
flock by providing the early scoop a week ago, delivering tickets on time, arranging for 
drink tix and a flexible format, led the team to the first half lead to start the day off, 
relinquished his 9 spot to Wayne who says he is retiring after this game, mediated a drink 
ticket dispute, reffed a portion of the game and filled for the French and bringing 
spectators.
<br/><br/>
Iron Man - Joe Freeman - loves the game so much he did not want to share - and scored a 
seismic share and ensured Nikko had wheels.  Joe slept with the trophy last night.

Hit of the day:  Niko on the opposition
<br/><br/>
Lost and found award:  Chris Gerrard still looking for his rabbit fur hat.

Longest try of the day year and career:  Special - calling for oxygen half way through the 
60 yarder.  Asked for the ref to call a penalty try with no one near after already getting one earlier.

This game was a real pleasure to be part of. Right off the bat John France 
aggressively fielded the opening kickoff and charged ahead to set a top quality 
ruck. Which we followed up with five or six (more even?), committing the 
bewildered Irish to feverish, confused defending, at which point we unleashed 
our backline, over into the right side for an excellent finish to the complete 
movement.
<br/><br/>
There were highlights aplenty. Lee did a masterful job with the penalty ball, 
finding the right option to get us moving forward. One of these was the best 
Geese try I've been involved in (barring perhaps this game's opener): clean 
tap at the mark, feed to the link man, quick hands to Zach who committed his 
defender, springing Jeff down the left line whereupon he made good ground 
committing threeÂ  (3?) defenders before offloading to the linking forward, 
then back inside where it eventually found Zach again who then sprung the 
out-backs free for the score. That's how I remember it.
<br/><br/>
And we had a 20m+ maul, nice and calmly shoved the ball right down their 
gullet. As impressive as this bit of work was for the serenity and deliberation 
we had during our downfield march, the setup was even better. One of our 
backs was caught just to the left of midfield by multiple defenders. Instead 
of getting all weak-noodled and going down we (sorry, I was busy trying to 
get over to help to remember who you were) held firm and strong until Ryan 
came in, hit the group good and solid, which held it up long enough for we 
forwards to arrive and add some full grown heavyweight man-push to the deal. 
It was beautiful.
<br/><br/>
And who can forget Dave Stuart's romp down the right side, gaining ground and 
getting behind their front defense? And then, once he had to go to ground, 
popped up the nicest little offload to be taken on another short distance, 
and when that was done Jeff was there for the nice quiet offload going forward 
with serious intent. Top drawer play in close quarters, that was.
<br/><br/>
Zach deservedly got Man of the Match, although he wasn't there to collect. 
He controlled the game, running forward when the opportunity presented itself 
and either offloading or powering into the tackle so we could control the 
contact zone and recycle through more phases, or passing to the outer backs 
when they had free and open ground in front of them.
<br/><br/>
A good day a the park.
<br/><br/>
Congratulations to the Irish for a robust game well played in the spirit of 
sportsmanship. Except for the one little dustup, with their man (Gerry?) not 
realizing that being flat on one's back, trapped at the bottom of a ruck, 
defenseless, isn't a good situation from which to try to headbutt someone. 
And that was really funny in its own way. Had to apply some effort to limit 
my amusement to smiling at him and not laughing outright.
<br/><br/>
Congratulations to Duma for refereeing. I think he did a good. Although 
I might be thinking differently if they'd scored one more try on a forward 
pass and/or knock on. 
<br/><br/>
On the whole, the result fairly reflects the game. We won.

A sleepy flock of Geese showed up in Baltimore late yesterday afternoon and 
took a while to wake up.  Baltimore had a good side show up with some good, 
strong runners.  They got to us early and a few times in the first period, 
mostly with breakaway runs.  The Geese settled down in the second and third 
period which saw Chris Gerrard, Jeff Lange and I think Brian Collins score.  
At the end, however, we did not have enough to overcome their big early lead.  
We played on a capacious pitch which tested our fitness and gave their runners 
room.  Henry made his return and had a good showing, Willie was back in good 
form and it was good to have Roger and Nick playing for us for a change -- 
we surely needed the versatility and skills of both.

The Wild Geese took to a rainy and muddy field today and presented an 
awesome display of rugby, beating the Poltroons 5 tries to 2. As I was cleaning 
jerseys my wife asked why the numbers 10-15 didn’t seem to be as dirty as the 
low numbered jerseys.  I had to explain that was because the pack was dominant 
snuffing ball movement of the opposition and the backs ran like race horses.
<br/> <br/> 
Three of the tries were out of a handbook on ball movement coming out of the 
pack with long open field runs by the back line and a display of ball handling 
and passing we have not enjoyed in some time.  Imagine in one movement the ball 
moving back and forth between Zach Joselyn, Willie Monohan, Brian Collins, and 
Joe Freeman with several other forwards and backs in the mix.    
<br/> <br/> 
One try  reflected a 60 yard back and forth with Joe Freeman scoring with six 
Geese side by side ready to dish off if needed.  The pack rock and rolled all 
day long; although we had some challenges in the lineout and not dominating the 
ball as much as we usually do.  We had several good rolling mauls in the pack 
setting up the ball for the backs to run like scared rabbits.   We had 
approximately 21 players on a rainy day and an away game.   I must acknowledge t
hat Ken Worm playing for the Poltroons was a beast and one of their dominant 
players.   The post match was a great hosting by the Poltroons at the Stained 
Glass Pub, a classic pub. Thanks to the Poltroons for their hospitality!!!!!
<br/> <br/> 
Thanks to the new players Jeff Stacks, Robert Dillon, Jeremy and Mike!

Great match this past Sunday with a good turnout. Thanks to the
Irish old boys that showed up.
<br/><br/>
We lost 3-1 in a tough match - we had our chances. Here is a quick
critique. First the backs did not produce scores which is our job -
we had a few too many bad passes and knock-ons. Anybody notice a
penalty play from about 8 meters out where the first ball carrier ran
out of bounds - seems like the same player (me) did the same thing at
the Celtic fest.
<br/><br/>
In the set piece their prop hooked about 1/3 of our ball somehow -
never seen that before. We only won about 50% of our lineouts. The
opposition at the generous post match party at O'Connells said that
we were not agressive to the loose ball on the ground - i.e., we
remained on our feet while they went in and took it - additionally
they said that we did not spread out around the base of the loose
once the ball was lost - we stayed in a tight cluster allowing more
space and overload for the Roosters to exploit.
<br/><br/>
The easiest thing to fix is improve our spread at the base of the
loose to form a wall of opposition - that is a habit we need to pick
up through talking more and awareness of what we should be doing.
<br/><br/>
Rule Tip of the week from Cam: if the player goes into the loose and
stays on his feet and the ball gets tied up (not on the ground) its a
turnover regardless of whether there is forward motion by the
offense. In a Ruck, when the ball goes to ground if the offense is
moving forward they keep possession.
<br/><br/>
Lets keep get better by continuously improving - don't worry about
the W/L column.

We played to a scoreless tie at halftime against a highly skilled hard hitting Bermuda side only to allow 3 quick scores during a torrential downpour to start the second half and then we came back with our own try only to allow one last score by the Bermuda Golden Onions (final 4 tries to 1).  More scoop to follow.  This tour was outstanding.
<br/><br/>
Thanks to all of the hard work by Roger Chaufornier to organize a 1st class outing in every respect, and Neal Henderson to handle other critical logistics.  A special thanks to Mike McGavick as our very generous host.  When we left the XL party tent last night several All Blacks were proudly sporting the WildGeese tour pins.

<h4>The Match</h4>
The Geese played a match we can be proud of despite the score. The Golden Onions of Bermuda assembled a squad that was big, strong, fast and skilled; their average age was probably not much more than that of our youngest player; their numbers included capped players from Wales, England and South Africa. But we went toe to toe and the Geese never backed down; for the majority of the time on the field we played an even match with them. Their pack ran at us with bone crushing attacks but Geese forwards stepped up every time to stop them. Their backs were quick and sure-handed but our defensive pressure forced numerous errors on them and our offence crashed through to put us solidly in their territory several times. One such crash, along with some solid work from the forwards, led directly to an assist from Brian Collins to Luke Chennery for our hard-earned try.
<br/><br/>
Though fiercely competitive it was an extremely clean match with no fighting and relatively few penalties. Every player on the field was a gentleman and the refereeing was perhaps among the best we've ever had.
<br/><br/>
<h4>The Tour</h4>
The accommodations were unbelievable. In the XL corporate tent Thursday and Saturday, and Mike McGavick's home on Friday, the food, drink and company were all outstanding. Mike McGavick, Brendan the Onion's captain, and some other team representatives went out of there way to spend time with us and make sure we were treated well everywhere we went. Was it mentioned that we were hanging out with the tournament champion Classic All-Blacks? (NZ held their opponents scoreless in both the semi finals against SA and the finals with defending champ Lions.) Even the weather cooperated more or less. Other than the downpour during and directly after our game we saw very few drops of rain in Bermuda.
<br/><br/>
Mention of our match can be found at the links below. Bermuda's main newspaper has the score wrong. The official tournament site had listed the Onions beating the Eagles, but the webmaster responded quickly to correct (see below).

Excellent work from the forward pack allowed the Geese backline a ton of ball which was put to good use even in bad conditions. Tim Desmond was all over the field providing great service to former 7's eagle Will Brewington at #10 - if there was a hole in Baltimores back line Will found it. Zach and Kenny (Frederick) really ran hard through the Baltimore defense. Jeff Arendt filling in at 10 and 12 played very tough on offense and along with the whole team played strong defense. Baltimore played strong the entire match. Frequent attacks from some very hard-to-tackle forwards kept the Geese pack on alert defensively. Geese stole one or two put-ins but set piece play was mostly even. Our forwards were slightly more mobile getting to breakdowns, and ran a few times for yardage including one from mid field to set up one of Tim's tries.

Yesterday proved to be an excellent match, fitting for the return of Nick Carino.  
The North Bay Old Boys arrived a little light, after their 2 hour trek, so the 
Geese generously loaned them 4 or 5 of our best.  The match started a bit flat 
but ramped up quickly as both sides moved the ball at good pace both in the 
pack and the backs.  The Geese started the scoring with a dot by Phil.  
North Bay had one held up in goal.
<br/><br/> 
After the first 20 minutes it was Geese 12 to 5.  The second 20 saw more scoring 
and the Geese led 19 to 12.  In the final period North Bay got over one more time 
to tie the score at 19 each, where it stayed until the post game revisions started.  
It has been reported to the selections committee that the Geese had 2 knock-ons 
in goal.
<br/><br/> 
Others should feel free to add the drama and hyperbole that this recounting 
lacks.  But it was a good, hard match and the North Bay guys played as well as 
they were good-natured.  We hope to add them to our fixtures for the future.

Another great rugby day. Thanks to the Poltroons for a good match 
despite the lopsided score. Thanks to Alexandria Rugby for 
graciously hosting us old farts to kickoff a great day of rugby where 
in the highlight match the side from Dundee Scotland beat the local 
PRU select side in a tight toughly played match.
<br/><br/>
Our game with the Poltroons followed the winning formula of the 
forwards providing plentiful good clean ball and distributing to the 
backs to finish. Chuck Goldston and Tim Desmond both dotted twice 
and on the first rugby match ever played on this pitch almost in my 
front yard I was fortunate enough to receive an assist from Phil to 
dot. Willie scored who else?
<br/><br/>
It was great to have Nick join us from Cleveland and anchor the front 
row. Thanks to everyone for the great turnout early on a Saturday.
<br/><br/>
Barr and I both helped lead some drills for a youth clinic held midday.
<br/><br/>
To celebrate the Red Bull girls stopped by my place after the match 
to unload their day's quota of red bull grab a veggie burger and 
run. Only Cam and I from the Geese made it to the after party at the 
Eagles club. Dave Stuart showed up to make sure no beer was left in 
the cooler at days end.

Ok enough rambling. Next week Harrisburg at Geeseland Park in

Yesterday against the French Roosters, the Geese started slow, and watched as 
the Roosters scored two tries in the first period.  As the Geese gained steam, 
they combined for two tries of their own, one by fly half Brian Collins, the other 
by Willy.  No extra points were awarded.  
<br/><br/>
At the end of 60 minutes the score was 10-10 and the captains agreed to a final 
10 minute period.  The French scored in that period and the Geese threatened
and got close to the  French 22 meter line before time was called.  Thus, 
the French eeked out their first (?) victory over the Geese.  It was a good game.  
<br/><br/>
Both sides had really good, heavy, packs and used them well. The Roosters were 
apparently bolstered by a couple of NZers, the Geese by our Kiwi, a Poltroon or
two and a Renegade.
<br/><br/>
The French backs were fast and showed great improvement in their attack and 
defense, which seemed to catch the Geese backs a little by surprise to start. 
But the Geese backs, with solid additions by a couple of newcomers, Jonathan 
and a Brit whose name I didn't get, played with the craft and guile that comes 
with slower feet.  Said Brit I think was the nice final assist to Willy for a 
text book try by the back line off loose ball. (Or was it the other way around?)
In any event, it was a good show.  
<br/><br/>
Now, as I was the ref in the final period, I owe an apology to Zak who made a
good tackle to stop a French attach and took possession.  
I blew the call.  Sorry, Zak.  Thanks for only grumbling, though.  
<br/><br/>
Thanks to the new guys for joining us.  Thanks to everyone for bringing food 
and drink for the Roosters. 
<br/><br/>
Thanks to Marc Floroux for taking most of the 
reffing duties.  Stay tuned, the French photogs will post pics online shortly,
methinks.

Gentlegeese and Friends,
<br/><br/>
It was a great day on Sunday with the Geese again taking on our new rivals, the Old (a misnomer), French International Team.  Again, the provided a great opponent and a good guest. 
<br/><br/>
The Geese, it must be said, were a little ragged around the edges and a little puffy around the middle.  To be expected, perhaps, after having months off.  The Geese drew first blood early on good second phase ball which left Big Joe Freeman out in the back line and who scored in a nice gallop from the offload by Brian, I think.
<br/><br/>
The Geese were in position to score a few times but enjoyed bad luck until Tom Gilgun plowed one through from the wing position in the second stanza.  (This did happen, didn't it?)  More Geese theatrics followed late in the game when Zack broke two tackles along the weakside to score.  
<br/><br/>
I believe the Geese held our French friends to one try, naturally by the ubiquitous Niko Prat who made a stunning run around the best the Geese had to offer to dot under the posts.
<br/><br/>
The French pack did well in scrums, often pushing us back and winning one against the head.  They won most line outs but we caught them sleeping at one of the early linouts, throwing in to Tall Steve without a call. We ran several eight-man pickups, taking advantage of "seven-hundred pounds of back row" (320 kilos). This tactic would yeild some gains, but moreover force the french to commit four or five players to stop the advance.
<br/><br/>
The Geese back line offense was decent, but stymied a bit by the young, fleet Frenchmen.  The French had more cohesion than they had a right to for playing together infrequently, made a great game of it and will only get better with more games.  All in all, it was a good start to the season for the Geese. 
<br/><br/>
Forwards linup: 1.Phil Emanuel, 2.John Boochever, 3.Neal Henderson, 4.(Tall) Steve Throson, 5.Guy Enderle, 6.Joe Freeman, 7.Jeff Walsh, 8.Larry Jannes; Subs: Henry Breton, Ken Worm, Mike Bruce, Roger Chaufournier, Cam Dunlop, Owen Walsh. French forwards well known to the Geese: 3. Nick Chaufournier, 7. Marc Florence Roux, 1, John Howe.
<br/><br/>
Backs: Downs, Coogle, Collins, Arendt, Monahan, Gilgun, Snyderwin, Daly, Zack, Lough,  
French backs well known to the Geese: Niko, Jean-Louis.  If I missed a name it was not from malice.
<br/><br/>
Booch is the consensus Ironman of the match, for playing the entire game at hooker.  Runners up include Larry J, Jeff W, Daly, Brian and Dave Stuart. 
<br/><br/>
Thanks to Roger C, John Howe, and Steve Lough for assuming the refing duties.
<br/><br/>
It was good to see old vet Brian Stotler drop, despite the heavy press after being named one of AARP's hotest dudes.  Even better, Geese (and Poltroon) Keith Neal returned sporting a little Afgan war memento.  Though he has always played like he was bionic, he may soon be. 
<br/><br/>
Our next match is Saturday, Oct. 4.  AT Western Suburbs.  KO time to be announced but it should be around 2 pm.  Lets have a good turnout there.  Niko, Jean-Louis -- please invite some of the more mature French players to join us for Suburbs.
<br/><br/>
Thanks to newcomer Patrick Button for taking pics.   
<br/><br/>
Thanks always to Jonathan for his pitch.  Safe travels back from Africa.

Write-up (by Brian Collins): The following Match Report was written by Brian Collins with important contributions by Jeff Walsh. (Like Beowulf and other Norse Sagas, it is best sung aloud at a mead hall and accompanied by a steady beat on a goat-skin drum.) 
<br/><br/>
Sunday the Geese took on our brothers from the North: Harrisburg. We fell behind by a quick 2 first period tries and then engineered a solid methodical comeback to win by a score of 31-20; five tries to four and we put up 3 conversions. 
<br/><br/>
The Harrisburg Pack came ready to play and smelled the try zone whenever they were inside our 22. The Geese used the 30 players that showed up by rotating to get everyone as equal playing time as possible (hey, why show up if you don't get a good workout). Willie took a high tackle and had to leave the game but appeared to be recovering at the social afterwards. Thanks to Wayne for his on-field medical leadership/and Captaincy. 
<br/><br/>
Jeff Daly started off the scoring finishing after a nice dish from Aaron who bursted on with great hustle to pick up a pass after a fortunate bounce of a pop kick. 
<br/><br/>
In the 2nd Period Jeff Arendt secured the lead by making a dummy pass and dashing 30 meters untouched for a nice try. The tide definitely turned when Arendt repeated the feat minutes later. 
<br/><br/>
The clincher was a try by 2nd Row Steve who took the pass at the 5 meter and plunged over the try line after securing the throw in. Steve celebrates his first try with the Geese. 
<br/><br/>
Roy played a nice game and had the last score of the game. On punching in to the try zone he went for center but was challenged by their hooker. The two collided badly. Roy managed to dot it, but both hobbled off holding each other up, requiring substitutes. 
<br/><br/>
A tough Harrisburg Pack worked us in the scrums early and scored all of their tries. Our forwards fought back and played a tough game in the loose and set piece and held their own as the game wore on. Frederick had a good showing with Pat Dumpe showing up at prop and other familiar faces making the trek. 
<br/><br/>
Thanks again to Jon Warner for hosting and mowing. Roger C. organized behind the scenes and in the Pack, and ran the grill afterwards. The best compliment of the day was the Harrisburg touch judge who said it was a fun game to watch. A compliment of the highest order. The Harrisburg team repeatedly mentioned how much they love coming to Jon's place to play us every Spring and we talked about making a venture up their way. In the post match bocci ball game they got their revenge. 
<br/><br/>
Thanks to our loyal female fans for cheering us on and supporting us: Pamela, Erica, Dusty, Michelle, and Ashburn wives Kristen and Kim, as well as the assortment of children who seemingly emerged from the forest. Larry was on the field early repainting the lines, and brought essential leadership during the game. 
<br/><br/>
We welcomed Touch Ref Tony back from a short tour in Iraq. He confessed that PTSD inflicted by the insults received while reffing us caused his early return home. 
<br/><br/>
A well earned victory was made bittersweet as we bid adieu to our Kiwi Aaron who packs off with his lovely wife and kids to the sunnier climbs and greener rugby pitches of Kiev. Aaron, we enjoyed playing with you and we'll miss your Kiwi skills. We'll hold a spot open for your return in a couple of years. Good luck to you and your family. We also say goodbye, at least for a while, to veteran Goose Keith Neal who is going to hot, bad, dry, sandy places for a while (no, not Ft. Lauderdale). Good luck, Keith. You always have a jersey with the Geese. 
<br/><br/>
Finally, remember that Summer Touch Rugby League sessions will begin Next Thursday, June 12th promptly at 7 pm. Potomac Elementary School. Niko says his French Embassy comrades may join us. Please tell anyone else interested to come join us. 
<br/><br/>
Good Spring Season, Geese. Well done.

The Poltroons new pitch was hidden away so well we almost did not have a side 
but persistence paid off and we fielded a strong side to score more and lodge 
an away victory. The Hosts graciously bought a round for the Geese post game 
players at a nice nearby bar. All and all a great rugby afternoon. 
<br/><br/>
Recap. The forwards dominated play providing a lot of ball for the backs to 
turn into tries. Niko, Jeff, Tom, and Chuck (Cole's bud that played with us a 
few years ago), all backs, each dotted with Niko and Jeff both putting down 
more than one with some crafty running and speed. 
<br/><br/>
Nick led the Pack up front with Booch raising hell at hooker. Neal and Steve 
were the power plant at 2nd row and Jeff (with stitches) had a stellar game 
at 8. Wayne, who at the after match party agreed to buy the next set of away 
jerseys (if they are pink) steadied the connection between the forwards and 
the backs. Niko was brilliant with his shifty moves and quick acceleration to 
space - maybe because his wife was photographer :-)? Cole came out of 
hibernation to dust a little rust off. Jeff Lange pulled pack duty at loose 
all game. Cam may have broken Aaron's nose by accident while playing for the 
Poltroons when his elbow came down after Aaron delivered a hard tackle. 
Aaron was running hard and breaking tackles so Cam may have tried to slow 
us down a bit, but Aaron was in good spirits and pledged to return to the 
pitch soon. Ross and Buck our other prop (sorry name slips me) with Nick 
helped fill out the pack 
<br/><br/>
(after reading Jeff's write-up I have to agree on the goal line stand at the 
end as the highlight, after Wayne delayed the game and they were awarded a 
penalty at the 5 meter line and fed it to Blitz for a high speed charge I 
thought he was in (from the sidelines) and then he stopped on a dime. Found 
out later from Erica it was her Hubby Neal that laid the wood to Blitz 
explaining Neal's Sunday evening plan to seek meds.) 
<br/><br/>
Pam played touch judge and felt disrespected when her girlie touch calls 
were occasionally ignored by Russ the Ref. Hey Pam, old boy rugby hearing 
is not like the college girls you coach - Congrats on you and Wayne's 
coaching job with UMD women to beat Va Tech Saturday! 
<br/><br/>
Jerry of the Poltroons turned 75 and we cheered him on at the bar afterwards. 
Blitz and the Poltroons ran hard but the Geese were too tough in the pack 
and quick in the backs.

Probably the most pivotal thing for us was scrum downs. We must have won at 
least 90% of their put-ins. One time when the ref announced that he was 
awarding a srcum to the Poltroons, Booch replied "Thank you Sir".
<br/><br/>
In loose play we won some and lost some, but seemed get enough clean ball 
out quickly to the backs.
<br/><br/>
Line-outs were a different story. We definitely lost many more of our 
throw-ins than we won of theirs. Fortunately for us they never really 
capitalized on this. Cam, who played flanker for us for a little while 
then switched over to the other side, was heard calling out "Its going 
to the second jumper!". We might have changed our calls, but it was a 
challenge enough to get half of our forwards to remember the ones we had.
<br/><br/>
Forwards never scored, but made several decent runs for yardage.
<br/><br/>
In the final seconds the poltroons were awarded a penalty inside our 22. 
Wayne (scrum half) held the ball for several seconds behind his back 
(but when asked for it he threw it to them). For this they were given 
an additional 5-yard (?) penalty. The Geese stopped two valiant attacks 
by a large forward and Blitz. I think both sides would agree that this 
goal line stand was the highlight of the game.
<br/><br/>
The backs simply made it look easy to run right through their defense 
almost any time they got the ball. I recall that Nikko, Daly, and Tom 
Gilgunn were among the try scorers
<br/><br/>
A gash from a car door sewn up on my chin, Wayne called out "Stitches" 
when the ball was going to me. Collins wants me to get the laces tatooed 
on after the real ones are pulled so we can keep the tradition.

   <td colspan="3" bgcolor="white">Write-up (by Brian Collins): 
First Match of Spring ended with a win. It was a Windy cold day but 
sunny with kickoff at 1:30 after allowing for everyone to get out of 
bed the first day after the clocks changed and find the pitch despite 
ice on the back roads and felled trees left and right from the high 
winds and heavy rains of the previous day.
<br/>
<br/>
The Baltimore Boars gave us a tough match playing the first period to a 
scoreless tie. The 2nd period the Geese backs took advantage of the 
plentiful ball from the Geese forwards and put down 3 tries maybe 4 to 
one for the Boars. In the final 2 10min periods the Boars roared back 
after shifting their game strategy to keep things in the forwards only 
to ultimately fall short by a few points.
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights include Jon Warner's return to the pitch with the Geese 
after successful rehab of knee surgery. The Geese fitness showed from 
weekly touch sessions during the winter at Roger C's training camp. 
Roger's son Roger Jr. lost his virginity on the pitch scoring for the 
first time after taking a nice pass
from Jeff ? who is new to the team this year and played his first 
tackle game - well done. John France also was a welcome addition to 
the Geese forwards.
<br/>
<br/>
Dave Stuart recovering from a sprained ankle donned some strange hat 
and ran touch and the grill after the game - trying to stay busy lest 
someone say something about his hat.
<br/>
<br/>
We used the gathering of the clan to also wish Tony our touch rugby 
field leader best wishes and safe travels for his 6 mos. duty 
assignment to Iraq. I heard that Keith Neal from the Geese will also 
be going to Iraq again - Keith be safe.
<br/>
<br/>
Back to the match. The forwards did an excellent job of providing a 
lot of clean ball for the backs but it took a while for the backs to 
finally finish after kicking away some golden opportunities (yes I am 
guilty) iin the first period. Larry at 8 man did a great job and was 
all over the pitch. Niko had a couple tries including a 95 yarder that 
showed great fitness and skill as he used the boot to guide the ball 
into touch and fall on a try. We won almost all of our set piece in 
the forwards.
<br/>
<br/>
There were a number of new faces on the pitch so I apologize for 
missing a few names but it was great to have everyone out and we tried 
our best as usual to share playing time as equally as possible.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to our fans with Roger's wife Nan showing, Neal and Erica who 
are headed to Nicaragua this week, and Dusty who slept in and showed up 
in time for the cookout. Jeff Lange's much marketed visitor took a 
pass so we will all have to wait until next time.

   <td colspan="3" bgcolor="white">Write-up (by Brian Collins): 
The Ancient Warriors/WildGeese had a good tour to Sunny Southern Florida and 
returned before they lost power Tues.  Great weather about 85 and sunny during 
the day with rain showers in the middle of Sunday and beautiful nights.  This 
tourney has A+ pitches and a great mix of Old Boy, Men's, and Women's rugby 
teams.
<br/><br/>
Here is a brief on/off pitch recap.  We went 1-2 losing our first game to Life 
for no good reason as we dropped on left and right (blame it on a slimy ball - 
I did).   Dave Stuart recalling his youth rugby days 
decided to party until 3, sleep in and take the field as Captain Hungover. 
Returning from the pre-kickoff Captains meeting with the ref he was unsure of 
who was kicking off.   Dave lambasted the boys at 
half-time much like a Marine Drill Sergeant with the philosophy of breaking us 
down to feel worthless and then hoping we would get mad and take it out on the 
opponent - except that the only thing we got mad at was Dave.   The Geese Pack 
won plenty of ball against Life but the backs squandered it.  Willie scored a 
nice finishing try on the last play of the first game - but we should've had a 
least 3 more from the backs.  They scored on the last play of the first half 
by Life was on a fluke play where a kick bounced right into an opponents arms 
for an uncontested try.
<br/><br/>
After our 9am game we waited until 3 to play a Jersey team who punished us for 
not having an experienced hooker and outweighed our pack by a good 250 lbs.  
We could've run circles on them in the backs but they successfully kept 
possession in the Pack.  We hung our heads for a bit, rescheduled our late Sat 
match for Sunday noon instead to allow us to regroup and we did. We came back 
Sunday and played a great fun game against Ft. Lauderdale winning 3 tries to 1 
with Steve Lough scoring twice.  Dave Martin took the leadership reins from 
Dave Stuart during the 3rd game and effectively used positive encouragement to 
get the most out of the Warrior Flock.  The pack again produced steady 
consistent ball for the backs that was the difference in the game.
<br/><br/>
The most amazing event of the weekend was the clinching Try of the Sunday 
match. Dave Stuart, either moping or because of a sprained ankle did not start 
in the Sunday game.  Wayne Harrison's son, a budding 12 year old rugby master 
watching from the sidelines counseled Dave telling him that with time running 
out in the 2nd half  &quot;we need you to get in there, you can win the game for 
us.&quot; And somehow Dave believed it, entered the game and as he was watching 
a ruck on the opposition's 1 meter line the ball suddenly bounds his way and 
like a magnet it sticks to his hands - and at that moment the prior 24 hours 
flashed before his eyes and he recognized an opportunity to redeem himself and 
proceeded to charge and dive untouched in for the score.
<br/><br/>
Miscellany:    The women ruggers at the pitch were great fun to mix 
with as the young women helped us temporarily forget the age difference.  
The Virginia Cardinals won the 45 and over.  Sat night under the lights the 
U.S. 23 and unders played a Scottish under 19 team in a match that was very 
fast and high quality with the U.S. falling short by 5 pts.  Bryce and Radar 
from Frederick and Wendell and Pete from Severn joined the contingent for the 
first time and were great additions.   We missed a few guys from past years - 
players missed from prior tours, Nick, Pat Dumpe, and Booch up front, and Jeff 
Arndt and Matt Downs in the backs were missed to name a few.  Match report from 
the over 55 game is that Wayne scored twice, one after running over an 
opposition defender to dot.  
<br/><br/>
Team:  Up front Bryce Cox, Mark Andrews, Henry Breton.  Second rows Ed Shafer, 
Dave Martin and Phil Dorsey.  Loose and 8, Dave Stuart, Dave Beaumont (sp), 
Roger LeCroy (living in Florida now) Radar (also played Scrumhalf), and Wayne 
and Pete Freeman at ScrumHalf, I played Fly and Centers were Red Scott Tilley 
(dinged Knee and out after 1st game) and a mixture of Cole, Steve Lough, Blitz 
and a few whores. Wings were OD and Willie.  Hooker was whored out except for 
a few spells during the 2nd game.  Fullback was a rotating mix of Cole, Steve 
Lough, and Michael?.

Thanks to all those that made it and those that didn't try to make it next year.

   <td colspan="3" bgcolor="white">Write-up (by Matt Downs): 
Yesterday, a thin but game Wild Geese squad took on an equally thin American 
University squad.  Fearful of playing the venerable Geese, the AU men took to 
the liquid courage the night before.  Perhaps they were celebrating their 
first playoff win the day before.  We'll never know for sure why, but 
distracted they were indeed, letting the Geese forwards dominate the ball 
and share it generously with the backs, who had loads of fun with it.  The 
scoring started with about two minutes in and didn't let up.  Conversion 
duties were shared by Jeff Daly, who has the most unawarded tries to date, 
and Jerry Crute, who still has too many unexcused absences. 
<br/><br/>
With one 20 minute period remaining, Brian Collins instructed the forwards 
to keep the ball inside and play possession rugby.  After a brief explanation, 
the forwards did just that, which led to a couple more scores.  Instead of 
demoralizing them, this roused the AU team from their doldrums.  The last 
10-15 minutes was good, hard possession rugby by both teams.  The last play 
saw a few phases of possession by the AU pack followed by a very nice back 
line play for their only score.
<br/><br/>
The Geese were undefeated this Fall.  Well done Geese.  Welcome again to all 
the new Goslings the last year or two:  Tom Gilgun, Henry Breton, Aaron Mayhew, 
Jeff's Walsh and Daly, Chris's Linder and Gerrard, Larry Jannes, Niko Prat 
and Marc Floroux, Jean-Louis, Joel, Willie Monahan, and Jim who played with 
us Sunday.  Missing names are due to dotage, not malice.   
<br/><br/>
Special thanks to Henry who is putting together the new Wild Geese web-site 
(<a href="http://www.WildGeeseRugby.com/" target="_blank">
 www.WildGeeseRugby.com </a>) with creative assistance by Jeff Walsh.

The Wildgeese competed with the Poltroons in a tough and close match that the
Geese ended up winning after three 20 minute periods. A strong showing of the 
Geese was welcomed by Jonathan Warner's beautiful farm and the leader of us all 
delivered beautiful weather. There were some amazing feats like Nick Carino and 
Dave Stuart, despite their girth managed to elude substitution and played all 
60 minutes.
<br/><br/>
Jeff Arendt started the scoring with a "save my ass kick" high to their 
fullback that took an Arendt bounce that he fell on for a 40 meter kick and 
score. Later the shorter Roger made a beautiful scoop of a post tackle ball 
and niftly touched down in the corner. Nico showed beautiful form by kicking 
for post penalties and conversions - a rarity for the Geese. Nico also set 
down a try as did Aaron I believe. The Poltroons put down a try late. Somebody 
else for the Geese scored. It was a very entertaining action packed game.
<br/><br/>
Several Geese filled with the Poltroons - Matt Downs and several others. 
The Geese match followed the Renegades hard fought close loss to the visitors 
from somewhere near the Bay. John France is continuing to improve this team 
and even played in the Geese match for the final 10 minutes that was really 
17 as Matt Downs felt the need for just a little more rugby.

Jon recruited several South Africans to bring some real intensity and 
fanfare to the world cup finals between South African and England that 
South Africa won in a dull game punctuated by more than excessive kicking.
<br/><br/>
After the game hay rides, great food, and a variety of other activities greeted 
the sunset on one of the more beautiful spots in the Washington D.C. area.

The Geese, Poltroons, W. Potomac and Western Suburbs gathered for the 
2nd edition of the Washington Area Old Boy Smackdown Mini Tourney.  
The Geese fielded a strong team, thanks to Wild Geese version 2.0.  
Veterans Roger C., John Booch, Guy, Roger (other), Dave Stuart (gamely playing 
despite a bad dental condition), Cole Black, Jeff Lange, Chris Augusty and 
Yours Truly were joined by v2.0ers Aaron, Henry, Larry, Jeffs Walsh and Daly, 
Phil, Chris's Linder and Gerard (whoring against us), Jean Louis, Niko and 
Joel, and v2.0 patch Scott Davis (?).  If I missed a name, its due to age, 
not malice.
<br/><br/>
The Geese played two 15 minute quarters against a good but not complete 
Poltroons squad.  Scoring were Jeff Lange and Niko off good second phase ball 
from the forwards and good ball movement and support among the backs.  
Final: Geese 12, Poltroons 0.

We again had a strong turnout for our match with Severn.  We had 19 suited up 
and playing and two others (Nick C and Gene) who were ready it step in if 
something untoward happened.  Nothing untoward happened.
<br/>
<br/>
As witnessed from the sidelines and reflected in the half-time score, 
the Geese came out fairly flat and Severn was a little eager.  Both forwards 
and backs were getting and moving the ball, but not to where it counts.  
However, a glimmer of things to come was seen with about 8 minutes remaining 
in the first period when Jeff Walsh, playing inside center, had a nice break 
off a loose ball toss from Lee.  Weak side winger Niko Prat, seeing an 
opportunity developing, crashed inside and was rewarded with a nice offload 
from Jeff which resulted in a beautiful 25 yard scamper. 
<br/>
<br/>
After a pep-talk at half, the Geese came out a new team.  Excellent scrum and 
loose play by the forwards was matched by a back line that moved the ball 
beautifully.  The result was a hat-trick by winger Wille Monahan, making his 
debut off the Injured Reserve list, and a 4th phase pushover try inside.  
Unnamed forward would have had another try but for his in-goal knock-on.

We played a brutally hot 15 minutes on Saturday against a rusty but solid 
Renegades.  On field temperature was Dante's third circle of hell before the 
clouds moved in and cooled things to a tolerable 90.  The Geese started off 
well, with good scrummaging and rucking by the forwards.  Clean ball resulted 
in excellent ball movement by the backs.  In the short 20 minute first period, 
Larry Jannes scored a pushover try and one of the backs scored on good second 
phase play.  I think Aaron was kicking conversions, and as far as I know he 
was a perfect 2 for 2.  
<br/><br/>
Second period saw another even match but with the Renegades scoring twice, 
almost a third but for new Jeff's shoe string tackle, and adding a pretty 
drop-kick penalty from dern-near midfield.  Shortly before time expired, 
Referee Barr Snyderwine, fearing lawsuit, called the game due to lightening.
